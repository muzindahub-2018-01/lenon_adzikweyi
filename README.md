# roll_a_dice.py
# A basic "roll the dice" program. 
# using the random module for this,since we want to randomize the numberswe get from the dice. 
#We set two variables (min and max) , lowest and highest number of the dice. 
#We then use a while loop, so that the user can roll the dice again. 
#The roll_again can be set to any value, but here it's set to "yes" or "y",but you can also add other variations to it.
